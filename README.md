This project, developed by Daniel Diaz, Mateus Lanzoni, and Juan Miguel López consists of a website that can show different cooking tutorials and their attributes, like a video link, ingredients used, etc. 
Users can also create an account to store their preferences, submit comments about the tutorials, and also the capacity to upload their ones!

You will also be able to find a document(Spanish) with a better and more accurate description of this project.

# Eassier Cooking

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd Backend/Frontend`

you do npm i to install dependencies, and do the same to 'cdd Frontend'
so that you can run it locally

### `npm start` to both Front and Back

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
